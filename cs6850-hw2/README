The program will run a given logic strategy on a set of logical clauses. Hopefully, this will give you an answer 
to the proposition the clauses were intending to solve.

To run the program, run the class 
    com.minethurn.logicworld.processor.LogicProcessor
    
    Usage: 
    
 -d,--delta <arg>      The file with the original database of statements
 -g,--gamma <arg>      The file with the query clauses
 -h,--help             Show the usage help
 -l,--rmLiterals       Remove pure literals before processing
 -s,--strategy <arg>   The strategy to use to find resolution.  Can be one of:
                       com.minethurn.logicworld.strategy.DefaultLogicStrategy,
                       com.minethurn.logicworld.strategy.DeletionResolutionStrategy,
                       com.minethurn.logicworld.strategy.UnitResolutionStrategy
 -t,--rmTautology      Remove tautologies before processing
 
 The input files should be of the form:
 
 { A(x), ¬B(x) }
{ B(x) }{¬A(x) }

The program can handle only literals at this time. No substitution of variables using a mapping currently work.
